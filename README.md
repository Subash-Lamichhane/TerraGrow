## Overview

TerraGrow is a web application designed to help you make informed decisions about planting crops based on environmental factors. By analyzing data such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) levels, temperature, humidity, and pH, TerraGrow provides personalized recommendations to optimize your planting strategy.

# Dataset 
[Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) is being used for this project. You can get this dataset from kaggle. The label encoded form of dataset can be found inside ```dataset``` folder.  
## Key Features

- **Smart Planting Recommendations:** Utilize data-driven insights to suggest the best crops to plant.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use web interface for inputting data and viewing crop recommendations.
- **Precision Agriculture:** Improve agricultural efficiency by planting the right crops in the right conditions.
- **Customizable Inputs:** Adjust parameters to match specific agricultural environments and preferences.
- **Educational Insights:** Understand the rationale behind each recommendation to enhance your farming knowledge.
